# Project description
This repository is an implementation of a basic Unix shell, realized as a solution to an assignment taken from the [ostep-projects](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects) repository.
The main goal of the exercise is to re-familiarize with the C programming language and to start approaching operating systems topics, as it deals with memory allocation and management of multiple processes.
For a thorough description of the project and explanation of its usage check out the [original repository](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/processes-shell).
